*** The code in this repisotory can be used to analyze RNA sequencing data ***
Raw data .fatsq or ft.gz input to the Alignment and counting code to align with established genome library and count the reads per gene
The result then submitted to DEanalysis.R to run for analysis
Further function like K-mean clustering, volcano plot and heatmap can be adapted from code.R
